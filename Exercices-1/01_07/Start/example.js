//CORE CONCEPTS OF FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING
// 1. IMMUTABILITY


// The first major concept of functional programming is immutability, 
// and it's a concept that may surprise a lot of people at first. 
// Most programmers learned early on that you could assign a value to a variable. 
// For example, we can define a variable called x and store the value five in it. 
// And then, later on in the program, we can change the value of that variable 
// to some completely different number. And later on, we can change this value again, 
// and so on. However, in functional programming, this is not allowed. 
// When we say that x is equal to five, we mean that, for the rest of the program, 
// x will only ever be five. There's no way we can change it. 
// In short, immutability means that most of the values in a program are constant, 
// which, in JavaScript, means using the const keyword instead of the var or let keywords. 



// 2. SEPARATING FUNCTIONS AND DATA

// The second main concept of functional programming is the separation of data and functions. 
// This is a case where functional programming is directly in contrast with object-oriented programming, 
// where data and functions are almost always grouped together.

// 3. FIRST-CLASS FUNCTIONS



//DECLARATIVE VS IMPERATIVE PROGRAMMING

// Declarative way of programming it's telling or expressing what something it is, while imperative programming 
// it's telling each step in order to do something.
// An example will be If I ask to grab me a bottle of milk in the fridge that is an Declarative way, while in 
// the imperative way I will have to saywalk in the kitchen open the fridge move the water get the milk close the fridge
// walk back to me.....
